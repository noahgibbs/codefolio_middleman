Fun/useful:

* featured images and thumbnails - debug them, use them for recent posts (and older posts?)
* Add recent posts to 'topics' page
* Pagespeed: MST
* Add real-ish image assets with thumbnails, multiple formats and a helper to generate refs to them

## Performance

* Consider removing FontAwesome for load-speed reasons

## Eventually maybe

* Add tags, do something resembling Horace's default use of them
* Add featured article(s), based on Horace's defaults
* Add images in top-bar and ability to add hero section
* Add simplelightbox.com
