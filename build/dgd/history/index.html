            <h1>A Personal History of DGD</h1>
            <p>Ah, DGD. It stands for &ldquo;Dworkin&rsquo;s Generic Driver,&rdquo; and it stands for something like eight years of my life as a young developer that I will never get back.</p>

<p>It was fun. And I was young and stupid. But still, fun.</p>

<p>DGD was descended ideologically from LPMUD, a style of MUD (1980s-era multiplayer text game) that used a C-like dialect for its internal language. All the ease of writing C for authoring, combined with poor documentation and never getting any respect, because MUDs!</p>

<p>DGD&rsquo;s dialect of LPC (LPMUD language) was both too weird to be easy for other LPMUD admins to use, and too simplified-looking for &ldquo;real&rdquo; C programmers. Basically, it was guaranteed to never be considered for its technical merits, regardless.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a shame, because it actually had some surprising technical merits.</p>

<h2>Technical Merits</h2>

<p>DGD had a weird-at-the-time runtime model which these days we&rsquo;d call &ldquo;evented.&rdquo; It has a lot in common with NodeJS, for instance.</p>

<p>The idea is that the code runs in very short time-slices, and DGD has built-in facilities to guarantee the code can&rsquo;t run very long, or use very much memory, before it&rsquo;s forcibly interrupted. That&rsquo;s important because a lot of system-level activity happens <strong><em>between</em></strong> these slices, so they shouldn&rsquo;t run too long.</p>

<p>One of the most amazing (and weirdest) things about DGD was <strong><em>atomic functions</em></strong>. That is, functions that worked like a database transaction. If there was an exception partway through it, it would roll back everything the function had done. <strong><em>Everything</em></strong>. Global variable writes, network and file I/O, <strong><em>everything</em></strong>.</p>

<p>How, you might ask? Because network and file I/O happen <strong><em>in between slices</em></strong>. You could <strong><em>schedule</em></strong> network writes or file writes, but they&rsquo;d go out after your timeslice finished, so they can be &ldquo;undone&rdquo; any time before that. You could ask for a network read, but the bytes came in before the slice started and you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;really&rdquo; read new ones. Reading is easy to undo via buffering anyway. It&rsquo;s writes that are hard.</p>

<p>DGD also allowed fully recompiling any of your objects, fully live. Recompiling your objects <strong><em>also</em></strong> happened in between slices. So inside any given DGD function you&rsquo;ll always get a single, consistent version of the object. But they can quietly change between slices, and then react <strong><em>to that recompilation</em></strong>, but they do it in the following timeslice.</p>

<p>You can imagine a retro-future where DGD succeeded massively and was used for giant, long-running systems that stayed constantly live. It never happened. But like the 1960s retro-future of The Jetsons, it&rsquo;s a glorious ideal and a fun idea that would never have actually worked.</p>
