    <h1>This is source/layouts/layout.erb - I Think Nothing Uses This!</h1>

    <p>There&rsquo;s a really good trick that many other disciplines use a lot, and we don&rsquo;t use much in computer programming. But I use it, personally, and it&rsquo;s really helpful.</p>

<p><strong><em>Work from reality so you can be surprised by complexity.</em></strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I mean by that.</p>

<p>Think of a situation where you&rsquo;re not the one setting the final terms. You could be building a web site for a friend, or programming a Raspberry Pi to control a robot. But the important thing is that if you screw the programming up, it will be wrong and you will notice.</p>

<p>This forces you to be honest. It forces you to notice when something is messed up, and then you need to fix it. You can&rsquo;t easily just say, &ldquo;well, I guess this is good enough&rdquo; or pretend that you always meant it to be that way.</p>

<p>The real world has more complexity than any of us could describe in a lifetime. In fact, it has that much in literally every square-inch cube of the universe. Not only is there unlimited complexity wherever you rest your eyes, you have to look <em>through</em> an indescribable quantity of complexity just to look at that spot - even if it&rsquo;s on of your own nose.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all natural simplifiers for that reason. We try to describe just a bit of the complexity of the world, and we hope we picked the right bits to describe.</p>

<p>However, if you stop after describing those bits then you&rsquo;re selling yourself short.</p>
