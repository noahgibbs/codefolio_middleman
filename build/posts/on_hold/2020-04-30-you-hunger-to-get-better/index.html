    <h1>This is source/layouts/layout.erb - I Think Nothing Uses This!</h1>

    <p>You hunger to get better.</p>

<p>And coding exercises don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re okay. But they&rsquo;re not what you want. You don&rsquo;t find yourself saying, &ldquo;oh, I need to do a few more coding exercises before I can write this code the way I want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you?</p>

<p>We can do better. <em>You</em> can do better.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not really sure what &lsquo;better&rsquo; looks like. Chasing after the framework, library or language of the week? That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;better&rsquo; looks like.</p>

<p>I have a hard answer. It&rsquo;s a good answer.</p>

<p>What you need are fundamental skills. If you want to know the framework of the week, become someone who can pick up that new framework when you need it.</p>

<p>But how do you practice &lsquo;fundamental skills?&rsquo; That sounds too abstract to mean anything.</p>

<p>But it isn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s an answer. I stole it from a profession that <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> founded in the twentieth century, and has been teaching for a very long time. Other people have solved this problem and it&rsquo;s time to steal their answer.</p>
