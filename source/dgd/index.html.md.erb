DGD. Dworkin's Generic Driver, arguably the finest LPC driver to have ever existed, and one that was rarely used by anybody. [There are reasons for that.](history.html)

I'm doing a little historical dig into DGD. As a side effect, I'm rediscovering old ways to use tools that were never documented very well. [I made the best attempt many years ago](https://github.com/shentino/phantasmal/tree/master/website/DGD) and it still wasn't great.

But I've come a long way in the, what, twenty years since then? Let's see if I can't make this historical curiosity easier to examine and appreciate.
