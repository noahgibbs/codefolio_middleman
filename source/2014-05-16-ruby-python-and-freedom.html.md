Ruby, on the other hand, is an experiment in
"give every toddler a chainsaw"-level freedom. And as Gary says in that talk,
you get some things like RSpec, ActiveRecord and Cucumber that simply aren't
possible at the lower "reasonable" levels of freedom.

95% of what only Rubyists can do with that freedom is horrible,
irredeemable crap.
But the other 5% couldn't have happened in any other way.
