<h1 align="center"> Noah Gibbs's Online Portfolio - Force </h1>

<p>
  Force is a UI refresh for ALP 3.0 based on
  <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>,
  <a href="http://www.clutter-project.org">Clutter</a>, and
  <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/">GObject</a>.
</p>

<h2> Simple Goals </h2>

<p>
  Force replaces the X11-based graphics and server we used in
  ALP 2.4 with much prettier, faster, more versatile OpenGL graphics.
  The plan, especially for the initial device, was to make a very pretty
  interface that "breathed".  In practical terms, that means lots of
  shaders, images and background animations running constantly.  Overall,
  we succeeded.

<h2> Server Architecture </h2>

<p>
  A lot of design decisions go into a server redesign.  I'll visit a few
  at a high level here.

<h3> Separation of Display and App Logic </h3>

<p>
  The X11 protocol is basically a windowing and drawing protocol.  Our aim
  for Force was to avoid this as much as possible.  We separated each
  widget into semantic components called controls which would communicate
  over IPC, and visual components called actors that existed entirely within
  the Force server.  For instance, a button's control might have
  the display text, and send an action when the button is pushed so that the
  application can respond.  But the button's placement, color, font and
  display animation exist only on the server side.  The button can be displayed
  in a different screen resolution or theme without the app needing to be
  notified at all.  This allows very quick response among overlaid applications
  with very little IPC, and encourages general and reusable app design.
  It also requires a very strict separation between visual code and UI code.
</p>

<p style="background-color: #E0E0F0; padding: 20px">
  Because display logic is separate, the device can rotate without having
  to notify the app.  Force switches between two different layout
  files transparently and immediately. <br/>
  <a href="album_vert_mono.jpg"> <img src="album_vert_mono.jpg" width="120" /> </a>
  <a href="album_horiz_mono.jpg"> <img src="album_horiz_mono.jpg" height="120" /> </a>
  <br />
  These are two different views of the same screen of the same app.
  Physically rotating the device will switch between them, but the app
  isn't even notified.  It just sees control signals, and both views use
  the same control objects.
</p>


<h3> Simultaneous Display </h3>

<p>
  A small but important feature of the server-does-display decision was
  that overlaying multiple windows with transparency became easy.  This had
  not been true under our GTK model.
</p>

<p style="background-color: #E0E0F0; padding: 20px">

  <a href="media_over_menu.jpg"> <img src="media_over_menu.jpg" width="120" /> </a>
</p>

<h3> Activities </h3>

<p>
  We were trying to switch from a standard, desktop-style process model to
  something more appropriate to the devices we targeted.  The Force
  activity model was a good compromise between innovation and backward
  compatibility, as well as ease of porting Linux applications.
</p>

<p>
  Fundamentally, each app consisted of only one standard Linux process.
  However, that process might host a number of different forms and activities.
  For instance, imagine a case where the user starts in the Calendar,
  taps a contact and goes to Contacts, and then taps the default profile
  picture to go to Camera.  At that point, a phone call comes in.  From
  the Phone app, the user selects "add contact".  Now Contacts is running
  in two different roles (see below).
</p>

<p><tt>
 Chain 1: Calendar -> Contacts (1) -> Camera <br/>
 Chain 2: Phone -> Contacts (2)
</tt></p>

<p>
  In this case, there is only a single Linux process for Contacts, and only
  a single event loop.  However, there are two sets of structures for the
  two different activities, and there may be several forms in each activity.
  Because of the way we designed our event API, this works out very neatly,
  and even still uses the GObject main loop.
</p>

<h3> Application Model </h3>

<p>
  Applications are shared libraries, as is standard for ALP.  The primary
  difference is that apps now link with the (very small) app-side Force
  library instead of GTK, and supply JSON files called CDF and SDF files
  instead of GTK's Glade files.  The CDF describes controls and app
  callbacks, while the SDF maps those controls to actors and visual
  properties.
</p>

<h3> Theming, But More So </h3>

<p>
  A primary concern of Force is to allow an application to
  connect its controls (widgets, basically) to very visually different
  applications with no change to the application.  Therefore, the
  images below represent both a simplified presentation layer for basic
  application bringup, and a more complex set of actors which require
  extensive OpenGL shader support.  It's important to realize that the
  set of actors can be traded out with a run-time option -- the application
  sends and receives signals over a socket to the server, and the server
  translates those signals into vastly different runtime displays.
</p>

  <a href="calc_mono.PNG"> <img src="calc_mono.PNG" width="120" /> </a>

  <br/> The same app runs either one, with two different resource files to
  specify the visual details.  Here is the Contacts app in each set of
  actors: <br />

  <a href="contacts_mono.png"> <img src="contacts_mono.png" height="220" /> </a>

</p>

<h3> Animations </h3>

<p>
  We had an in-framework facility for animations, but it basically wasn't
  used by the actual on-hardware release.  They went straight to Clutter's
  low-level animation facilities.  This had some hiccups here and there, but
  basically worked fine.
</p>

  <a href="menu_2_mono.jpg"> <img src="menu_2_mono.jpg" width="120" /> </a>
</p>

<h3> Embedded Forms </h3>

<p>
  Another neat property of our server architecture was the ability to run
  an application inside a section of another application's form.  This is
  somewhat similar to facilities like
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding">
  Windows OLE</a>, and our "multiple activities, one Linux process" model
  made it a good fit for many of the resource management strategies we
  used in our applications.
</p>

<h2> My Role </h2>

<p>
  While Force was written by a large team, I was one of the
  initial team of four designers.  Of the four, one was less involved
  and left the company several months later, and one was primarily an
  application API architect rather than a server architect.  Thus, I was
  one of two primary server architects and implementors.  This architecture
  represents a lot of work and design specifically done by me.
</p>

<p>
  I worked primarily on the central server code.  I also wrote some, and
  debugged a lot, of the server-side actor and control code.  And other
  work as needed, as you'd expect.
</p>

<h2> Framework vs Hardware </h2>

<p>
  Force was the name of the internal ACCESS-specific framework
  we designed, which is part of
  <a href="http://alp.access-company.com">ALP</a> 3.0.  There was a
  separate, concurrent project to build a device using this framework
  on hardware <a href="http://www.popgadget.net/2008/10/emblaze_mobile.php">
  also used for another project, which wasn't released</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We wrote both actor sets so that we could do early testing before we
  had full OpenGL implementations of actors.  The simplified actors also
  worked better on the simulator, which had only software OpenGL, and
  couldn't accept shaders.  Initially simplified actors were to act as
  examples to the programmers writing the final shaders, and to be
  expanded from, but they wound up being maintained for use with the
  simulator and to check the scope of particular bugs.
</p>

<p>
  Conveniently, the simplified actors are an example of Force
  running in a different theme.  Other examples, on other real
  hardware, are likely to happen eventually but none are yet
  announced.
