(NOPE, DO SOMETHING BIOGRAPHICAL)




I talk badly about coding exercises pretty often. In [my RubyConf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33fAzjOTaDE) I gave an I-think-better alternative to them. I gave a very quick run-down of why I wasn't a huge fan of them.

But what's so wrong about coding exercises?
