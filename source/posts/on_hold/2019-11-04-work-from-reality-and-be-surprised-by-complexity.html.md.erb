There's a really good trick that many other disciplines use a lot, and we don't use much in computer programming. But I use it, personally, and it's really helpful.

***Work from reality so you can be surprised by complexity.***

Here's what I mean by that.

Think of a situation where you're not the one setting the final terms. You could be building a web site for a friend, or programming a Raspberry Pi to control a robot. But the important thing is that if you screw the programming up, it will be wrong and you will notice.

This forces you to be honest. It forces you to notice when something is messed up, and then you need to fix it. You can't easily just say, "well, I guess this is good enough" or pretend that you always meant it to be that way.

The real world has more complexity than any of us could describe in a lifetime. In fact, it has that much in literally every square-inch cube of the universe. Not only is there unlimited complexity wherever you rest your eyes, you have to look *through* an indescribable quantity of complexity just to look at that spot - even if it's on of your own nose.

We're all natural simplifiers for that reason. We try to describe just a bit of the complexity of the world, and we hope we picked the right bits to describe.

However, if you stop after describing those bits then you're selling yourself short.
