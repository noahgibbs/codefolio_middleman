Instead, I'm going to talk about the basic types of objects you need to have, and what problems they solve. I'm not trying to help you fine-tune which exact camera or microphone (or whatever) you need. I'm trying to help you understand that no matter what camera you have



## But What's Wrong With It? (REPEATED AS AN INDEX)

Before jumping into more equipment it's worth asking: what's wrong with that? Clearly I got by on this quality of recording for years. Why change it? And eventually I'll answer how I fixed these problems with blog posts. But by talking about the problems, you can understand why a Â£300/$400 recording setup probably won't meet your needs forever.

First: the picture doesn't look great. It's blurry and low-resolution. That's okay if you're recording a technical talk &mdash; you just need to see my overall body language. It's fine for a meeting or discussion group for the same reason. You'll notice I overlay my slides in my videos because it's ***not*** good enough to properly see slides so I have to add those back with video editing. That's okay, though. Filming the slides isn't great anyway. You're better off adding them back at full quality no matter how good your camera is.

Second: it's not very flexible about setup. I can't film from very close to myself (can't use a wide-angle lens) or very far from myself (can't use a longer-distance lens, and resolution is too low to magnify it.) I also can't easily film from behind the audience (the tripod is too short and the resolution too low) or do close-in shots (similar reasons.) Even in a small room I can't film myself from very high with the short tripod, so you'll see a lot of my hairy nostrils from slightly underneath. You're welcome.

Third: the editing is kind of painful. I can take video from the camera (maybe more than one) and my screen (to sync up slides later) and record audio. But then I have to take all these different bits and re-combine them at the end. Really expensive gear allows you to run a time-signal everywhere for later syncing, which allows the painful editing to be really exact. But cheap gear just assumes you're going to have a hard time *and* do a bad job. It's worse than that, because different software and hardware will often record at ***very*** slightly different rates, so a two-hour talk can have an extra second or two of drift between your video and your audio. By the end of the talk it can be pretty far out of synch.

Fourth: I have to practice and rehearse a talk pretty extensively before I can film it. I can't read the words unless I'm looking down and ignoring the audience, even in a small room.

I'll answer one part at a time, as a series of upgrades. What's the problem? How can I fix it?










First problem: the picture doesn't look good. It's blurry and low-resolution. This, of course, is the ***expensive*** problem to fix. Because the answer is a better camera.

A low-end camcorder like a Canon Vixia has a lens built into it, and you can't change it. It has a certain amount of zoom built into it, and a certain quality of image, and that's it. The way you do better is to buy a nicer camera. What kind of nicer camera? Something that looks like Peter Parker might carry it around as a newspaper freelancer. For historical reasons they're called DSLRs ("digital single-lens reflex.") Those cameras have detachable lenses, so you can get a long-distance high-magnification lens ("telephoto lens") or a cheap mid-distance lens you can change easily ("zoom kit lens") or a tiny lens for close-up shots ("premier wide-angle pancake lens") or whatever you want, but use the same camera with it. You can also buy another camera later and keep all those lenses, provided it's a similar sort of camera from the same camera company. [Canon has a few different types of lenses](https://www.canon.co.uk/lenses/tech-guide/compatibility/), for instance. All Olympus lenses fit all Olympus cameras. [There seem to be a lot of different non-interchangeable Sony lens types](https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/62118/are-sony-nex-and-sony-alpha-lenses-interchangeable). But if you buy a camera from one manufacturer, you're buying into their lens system, probably for the long term. Good lenses will often cost as much as a good camera or more and they're surprisingly complex and temperamental. It's not easy to switch.
