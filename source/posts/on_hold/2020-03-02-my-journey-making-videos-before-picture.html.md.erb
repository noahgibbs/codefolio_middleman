title: "My Journey Making Videos: The 'Before' Picture"

Here's the good news: I am all kinds of not-an-expert on serious video equipment. That means I'm stumbling through all this a lot like you are. If you're trying to get set up to do how-to talking head videos, I have just done a lot of the same research you will. And I'm on a fairly modest budget &mdash; I can spent a few hundred pounds on the right piece of equipment, or up to a thousand or so on a major bit like a camera. But if you say five thousand pounds I'm going to start looking for a much cheaper option. If you say the whole setup could be as little as ten thousand pounds (for Americans: roughly $13,000 to $15,000), I'll start mumbling about how I'll add that to my "long-term wish list." And then probably never buy it.

(I am getting 'better' about this lately. And then I need to stop for awhile and see if that brings in more money. Because if it doesn't, I'm probably back to being cheap. [Self-employment is new for me](http://codefol.io/posts/starting-a-new-adventure/) and I'm still figuring it out.)

I'm not going to give you a full comparison of different cameras or microphones by quality or price. There are already great posts on that: [Matt Stauffer on different levels/prices of A/V setup](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/setting-up-your-webcam-lights-and-audio-for-remote-work-podcasting-videos-and-streaming/), or Olivier Lacan's [how-to for audio](https://olivierlacan.com/posts/loud-and-clear/) [and another for video](https://olivierlacan.com/posts/in-sight/). [Dan Benjamin has one too](https://danbenjamin.com/podcastmethod/) that I found later and it made a good compare/contrast.

Today, I'll talk about my early 'before' setup which was a *great* way to learn this stuff, for years. And it's ***taken*** me years to get to this point. I'm a little slow.

## The "Before" Picture

When it comes to making videos, I occasionally [record myself giving talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvvFLwG8Avc). I've spent some quality time with [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) and (less often) [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) to learn the basics of video editing. I started with Camtasia, mostly because it used to be a lot cheaper than Final Cut. If you're reading this "before" article as a how-to, you may want to look into iMovie or something similarly cheap, especially since Camtasia now costs three times what it did when I started with it (and [has a few other problems](https://support.techsmith.com/hc/en-us/articles/203727528-Camtasia-Mac-Web-Cam-Recording-is-Out-of-Sync-Pixelated-or-Has-Low-Frame-Rate) that preclude high-resolution capture with nicer webcams.)

So if [videos like that](https://youtu.be/iG42qdqStkc?t=1803) are the "before" picture, how's it done? If you want to get to *that* point, what does it take?

Not much, it turns out. Here's the basic supply list:

* A consumer-level camcorder; I used an old Canon Vixia. It looks like [a new one goes for £190/$245 or so](https://slrhut.co.uk/item-1110c14-canon-vixia-hf-r800-camcorder-black), and it's better than the one I bought years ago. If you only have a webcam then it's very hard to video yourself in a larger room or a meeting. But a webcam will work better for just getting video of your face as you sit as a desk, so you can use it too if you have it.

* A tripod; I used a cheap aluminum Vivitar that I got in a "start taking videos!" bad package deal; it weighs nothing, has limited stability, and you can get something similar for £20/$25.

* A microphone; don't just use the one in the camera, it'll be terrible; I used a £50/$60 Blue Snowball for most talks because it's extremely noise-tolerant yet good for audience Q&A and I don't have to care where I put it. How bad is an in-camera microphone? So bad that a £35 Blue Snowball, plopped down on a table in a noisy room, is a significant upgrade.

* An extension lead or two (Americans: "extension cord"), whatever storage card your camera uses, probably a cable to connect your camera to your computer and whatever other bits and bobs you prefer. Optional: camera bag, or you can use a nice duffel or cardboard box. I have used all of those, individually and in combination.

* A video editing program to bring it together. If you have a recent Mac, iMovie is free. Google Search looks like you can find cheap or free Windows and Linux video editors as well.

So if you want to be able to make [videos like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvvFLwG8Avc), that's probably a £280/$360 undertaking all told, mostly for the cheap camcorder.

## But What's Wrong With It?

Before jumping into more equipment it's worth asking: what's wrong with that? Clearly I got by on this quality of recording for years. Why change it? And eventually I'll answer how I fixed these problems with blog posts. But by talking about the problems, you can understand why a £300/$400 recording setup probably won't meet your needs forever.

First: the picture doesn't look great. It's blurry and low-resolution. That's okay if you're recording a technical talk &mdash; you just need to see my overall body language. It's fine for a meeting or discussion group for the same reason. You'll notice I overlay my slides in my videos because it's ***not*** good enough to properly see slides so I have to add those back with video editing. That's okay, though. Filming the slides isn't great anyway. You're better off adding them back at full quality no matter how good your camera is.

Second: it's not very flexible about setup. I can't film from very close to myself (can't use a wide-angle lens) or very far from myself (can't use a longer-distance lens and resolution is too low to magnify much.) I also can't easily film from behind the audience (the tripod is too short and the resolution too low) or do close-in shots (similar reasons.) Even in a small room I can't film myself from very high with the short tripod, so you'll see a lot of my hairy nostrils from slightly underneath. You're welcome.

Third: the editing is kind of painful. I can take video from the camera (maybe more than one) and my screen (to sync up slides later) and record audio. But then I have to take all these different bits and re-combine them at the end. Really expensive gear allows you to run a time-signal everywhere for later syncing, which allows the painful editing to be really exact. But cheap gear just assumes you're going to have a hard time *and* do a bad job. It's worse than that, because different software and hardware will often record at ***very*** slightly different rates, so a two-hour talk can have an extra second or two of drift between your video and your audio. By the end of the talk it can be pretty far out of synch.

Fourth: I have to practice and rehearse a talk pretty extensively before I can film it. I can't read the words unless I'm looking down and ignoring the audience, even in a small room.

I'll answer one part at a time, as a series of upgrades. What's the problem? How can I fix it?
