You hunger to get better.

And coding exercises don't do that.

They're okay. But they're not what you want. You don't find yourself saying, "oh, I need to do a few more coding exercises before I can write this code the way I want to."

Do you?

We can do better. *You* can do better.

You're not really sure what 'better' looks like. Chasing after the framework, library or language of the week? That's because you don't know what 'better' looks like.

I have a hard answer. It's a good answer.

What you need are fundamental skills. If you want to know the framework of the week, become someone who can pick up that new framework when you need it.

But how do you practice 'fundamental skills?' That sounds too abstract to mean anything.

But it isn't. There's an answer. I stole it from a profession that *wasn't* founded in the twentieth century, and has been teaching for a very long time. Other people have solved this problem and it's time to steal their answer.
