Ruby and Python, so similar and so different. By which I mean, "the languages let you do the same things in most of the same ways, but the communities are utterly different."

<h3> Community Mores </h3>

Python says, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">there should be one &mdash; and preferably only one &mdash; obvious way to do it</a>.

Ruby, like Perl, says <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1605-writing-readable-ruby/">there's more than one way to do it</a>. More specifically, the community is <i>okay</i> with there being <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">more than one way</a> to do it.

Python tries very hard to keep a single consensus. The Ruby community says, "have fun, come back, show us what you built!"

<a href="http://raganwald.com/2008/07/my-analyst-warned-me-but.html">The Ruby folks tolerate the mistakes, steal the best stuff, and adopt it &mdash; we think everybody should have really sharp tools.</a>

And, sure, sometimes there are problems.

<h3> Problems and Solutions </h3>

If you take the best 2% of <a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/gervais-macleod-12-growth-chaos-and-risk/">utter chaos</a>, you get some chaos in the results. "Best" is hard to judge, right?

So you get wildly different tools and ideas every few years &mdash; <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>, <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/hoe">Hoe</a>, <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, <a href="http://rvm.io">RVM</a>, <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a>, <a href="https://github.com/voxdolo/decent_exposure">Decent_Exposure</a>)... And somehow, the community takes it all in good humor. There's a little fashion-mongering &mdash; <b>"nobody's <i>still</i> using RVM, dahling, it's all <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> these days!"</b>. But mostly, we take the best, adopt it and keep building great software.

The Ruby community reminds me, over and over, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan">Warren Ellis' Transmetropolitan</a>. It's about a wonderfully dystopian future and a whacked-out journalist as your view into it...

<br/><br/><tt>This city never allowed itself to decay or degrade. It's wildly, intensely growing. It's a loud bright stinking mess.<br/><br/>It takes strength from its thousands of cultures, and the thousands more that grow anew each day.<br/><br/>&mdash; Spider Jerusalem, Transmetropolitan</tt> <br/><br/>

The Ruby community is <i>exactly</i> that kind of loud, bright, stinking mess.

And as he says... "but God help me, I can't imagine living anywhere else."
