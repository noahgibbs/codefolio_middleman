Have you guys seen <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">BootSwatch</a>? It's awesome.

Relatedly, I just redesigned <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding-Rails.com</a> so instead of a horrific eyesore, it now looks pretty generic.

You know that complaint that designers mention, the one that goes, "and then your site will look just like all these other sites put together by mediocre designers"?

I really hope some day <i>that</i> is my complaint. "Mediocre designer" is far more praise than my design skills deserve.

Good thing I'm a <a href="http://static.angelbob.com/portfolio">programmer</a>, huh?
