When I was taking the <a href="http://online2.msf-usa.org/msf/Default.aspx?wvsessionid=6a4ad4b138474bcfa211b2ade223660d#&panel1-1">Motorcycle Safety Foundation</a> class awhile back (it's awesome!) they said something that stuck with me.

"None of you are good enough to hit your motorcycle's limits, even with these little bikes. You'll have to ride for years before you're hitting the bike's limits instead of yours."

I'm close to 40. I will never again get smarter, quicker, or have a better memory. My brain has a performance curve -- I haven't hit the "descending rapidly" part or anything, but it doesn't go up from here.

It has still taken many years to start hitting my brain's limits. I just wasn't a good enough operator yet.
