Different people can look at, say, a video tutorial and take different things from it.

A new programmer looks at what the video is "supposed" to teach and learns the immediate skill and how to do something in that language or environment.

An experienced developer learning a new language learns how to do a task they already know in a new setting.

A very experienced developer looks at the idiom and workflow, and learns how the author approaches problems more generally.

A good communicator watches the video and learns about how to explain, how to communicate and demonstrate.

These are far from all the examples, and the same person can be more than one.
