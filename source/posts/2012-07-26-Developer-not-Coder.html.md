There's a lot to developing software on a team that universities don't
traditionally teach you. If you're already strong at theory and
skills and you know you also need lots of practice, what else should
you be doing to prepare?

Developing on a team requires a lot of people skills. Junior software
developers are often "junior" specifically because they lack those
skills - it's not uncommon to see junior developers with better "hard"
skills than much higher-ranking and more senior developers. Indeed,
it's easy to become bitter about that as a junior developer because
you can't yet see what separates you from them.

Here are some examples of that separation:

- More senior developers have been doing this longer and can often
  estimate the difficulty of a task with greater accuracy. This is
  required so that managers of various kinds have a better idea of
  when you'll be delivering that software. That's utterly vital in
  business, but often treated as unimportant by developers ("it's done
  when it's done!").

- More senior developers often better understand the business climate
  surrounding their software, and can prioritize features and effort
  independently because they know what parts of their software are
  most vital to actually *selling* that software. This is often
  unrelated to raw functionality.

- More senior developers often understand other roles in the company
  better (sales, marketing, management, etc.) and can better optimize
  their communication and even their software to help those people.
  How do you make the software easy to demo impressively so that
  marketing can do better with it? How do you make it more obvious
  *as you build* which parts aren't done yet, and how done they are,
  so that management and non-technical people understand progress?
  How do you build software so that it's easy to see its current state
  for non-technical folks like customer support? How do you make it
  tool- and GUI-friendly so non-technical people can interact with it?

- Great senior engineers have a deep love of documentation and
  automation. That's because other people adopt your stuff more
  readily if your code has it, and because it's far easier for you to
  pick something up later if you made it trivial to dig in and get
  started.

- More senior engineers can often pick up new tools and codebases
  quickly because they spend a lot more time understanding and
  maintaining bad code. There are many sub-skills to this - it's
  complicated to learn well, and mostly you just need a lot of
  experience at it.

So, sure, that's a fun little sales pitch for experienced senior
developers. But what do *you* do to become one?

- Pick up bad code. There's a ton of bad open-source out there, it
  doesn't specifically have to be corporate bad code. Fork something
  abandoned on GitHub with a toolset you don't usually use and start
  playing with it. Build some of that documentation and automation
  into it so that it's easy to get started. And "bad" doesn't have to
  be pervasive. Just pick something that's not terribly popular
  without an easy on-ramp for new developers.

- Read business books, especially those aimed at marketing, sales,
  management and product/project management. Blog posts help too, but
  nothing beats a full book. This isn't the best way to learn other
  people's roles, but it's (usually) easier than tracking everyone
  down and beating it out of them :-P

- Use a real development methodology when you're working, down to
  writing out task cards, estimating tasks and moving the cards
  between columns on a board. You'll feel stupid doing it, but
  nothing beats having actually worked that way. Scrum and Extreme
  Programming are good choices that aren't too hard to get started
  with and don't add too much overhead. The reason to do this, by the
  way, is to get good at estimation. The rest of the process may help
  a bit, but by far the most important part is that you actually break
  up projects into sub-tasks and estimate those sub-tasks. Then see
  how close you came when you're done.

- Read case studies of companies, successes *and* failures. You can
  do this with business books, but read up on current (business)
  events, too. You're trying to get a feel for how products succeed
  or fail. That's a lifetime of work to do really well, but if you
  put fifteen spare minutes into it once a week, you're still ahead of
  most developers.

Then, do all the same things you know you need to. As you say,
develop. If you come up with projects that may be useful and then
promote them, that will teach you a huge amount of the rest.

Oh -- and make sure you're the one that has to maintain them! That's
the other bit you should be learning, basic operations!
