When we sit down to practice a skill, you'd think we'd just throw ourselves into it with gusto. I don't just mean you and me &mdash; why wouldn't everybody do that? It makes us better at something we care about. We've found the time to get better at it. That's awesome!

So why do we hold back? Why do we worry?

Many reasons, but here's one: we're afraid we're wasting our time.

What if we're practicing *wrong*? What if there's some better way to do it, and we'll be sad we bothered? What if we're suckers for putting in these hours that do us no good?

I can't magic your (and my) fear away, but I can do for you what I do for me: I can talk through it and explain it. I always come through feeling better afterward. Maybe you will too?

## Time Well-Wasted

I'm a software developer, and I see the world through a particular, specific lens. It gives me specific strengths, and specific blind spots. Here's one of my blind spots: it bothers me when I feel like I'm being inefficient. When I spent four hours trying to make a language or tool do something, and there was a five-minute solution that I just missed (or it wasn't documented,) I absolutely ***rage*** about it.

Maybe that bothers you too?

It's not really rational. I *did* learn a lot in that four hours. I searched through all kinds of useful, interesting stuff about the tool. But if I'm driven by working on some specific problem, that's four hours that didn't do anything for the problem I care about.

That's the dark side of learning by doing &mdash; documentation rage is an expected side effect of learning via projects you care about. Everything is a tradeoff.

But the flip-side is that in that "wasted" time you actually learned a lot. You just didn't learn what you *wanted* to learn. It's frustrating, but it's not actually unproductive. In fact, often it teaching you all that debugging that you sat down with this new tool in order to learn.

And often, I've learned (or just practiced) some important kinds of debugging. This will help me do less of that in the future. That's not unproductive. It's my job!

## But What About Learning Wrong?

Some of the most frustrating time is time that is *really* wasted, in the sense that I learned the wrong thing, or learned a thing wrong.

I might have learned a feature and then discovered it's for some completely other purpose. Or I'm never going to use it because it just doesn't work very well.
