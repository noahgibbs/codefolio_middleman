Like most developers who have been developing awhile, I have my favoured ways to keep myself productive. Most are standard: careful use of caffeine, a frequently-curated TODO list, an obvious place to check my priorities, occasional retrospectives and so on.

I also have a few less-common ones that I swear by. That's normal too. But of course, every developer has their own set. These are mine.

Perhaps they'll help you? If not, they'll give you a reason to make fun of me, which is nearly as good.

## The Done List

I keep a text file of done tasks day-by-day. I find that the better I keep it up to date, the better I'm usually organising my work. At least, if what I'm doing has a lot of little pieces. Occasionally I'm only working on one big project and then I don't need this as much.

Here's an excerpt from it as I write:

<pre>
2020-02-11 Tue:

RR  Initial recording for RR MVC workshop. I do *not* like how the
    from-slightly-below upper-body thing looks; the light is bad
    but, like, *all* of it is bad. Maybe seated? Or talking-head
    video? The very high resolution does me *no* favours, either.
MST More sales-page polish-up; still needs more, but this feels useful
ENT Put together the initial draft of a workshops page; still a bit rough
ENT A/V research; okay, I've definitely veered too far into 'some
    day'; short term, maybe order a better mic and maybe not, plus
    some technique practice
ENT Canon lens research; maybe eventually I'd like a wide-angle lens,
    but probably not yet - even EF-S mount, they're not really cheap
MST Started writing new blog post, practice-flavoured
MST Oh hey, I hadn't added most folks to the Slack channel for
    preview blog posts. D'oh!
BOD Caught up on exercise
ORG Checked USGlobalMail, marked tax docs for scanning
--- Breakfast, caffeine

2020-02-10 Monday:

MST Recorded podcast w/ Jason Swett
ENT Lots of video setup, some minor writing
--- Driving lesson was cancelled
--- Breakfast, caffeine

(Weekend: emailed people to get Slack set up w/ blog post preflight folks)

These are little notes to myself. If I were going to write a "what did you do this week?" summary, this would be one of my first places to check &mdash; the other would be the 'completed' category in OmniFocus, my TODO list.

By having a thing I'm currently doing, I keep myself on something vaguely resembling a useful task. I sometimes write it down before I'm done, and that's not a bad thing. It means I'm asking myself, "what would be the useful reason to do this thing I'm doing?" If I can't think of one, it's generally time to change tasks to something useful. You'll notice the A/V research above starts useful and gets progressively less useful, so I cut it short when I've wandered too far off the point.

I used to have a single 'Done.txt' file that I'd keep for months, adding slowly to the top and rolling over annually &mdash; or less often. These days I have a weekly plan file with the 'done' section at the bottom and various stuff I hope or plan to do this week at the top. That makes it a lot easier to compare what I hoped to do and what I actually got done. But if you decide to do this for yourself, start with a simple 'Done.txt' and add to it a little at a time. You don't need those little "project code"-type tags, either. I'm not even sure I
need them or will keep them &mdash; they made more sense when I was distinguishing between work for another company and work I did for
myself. They'd be a really good idea if you were also juggling different professional requirements or projects, though. But if you do
that, you probably already have a better tracking system than I do.

## What's Important?

I always like explaining what I *get* from a particular practice, and why it fits with my priorities.

This one helps avoid my tendency to lose focus, of course. And my love of [game-ified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) things with points systems. I like ticking off todo lists and putting 'done' items where I can see them.

But its less-obvious advantage is this: when I'm working on something, I'm figuring out what it would look like as a 'done' item. A good 'done' item doesn't just say what I did. It reminds me why I'm doing it. Some of the items above (video setup, recorded a podcast) are 'obvious' in the sense that I don't further record what they're for &mdash; a podcast is to tell people I exist and what I do, and the video setup is also for audience-building, eventually, as I record video. And some things are overhead ("marked tax docs for scanning") so I can see how much of that there is.

But for some items like the A/V research, keeping my 'Done' file in mind helps focus me while I'm doing it. When I get to 'someday' research, I need to course-correct. I'm going to be writing down my conclusions in a few minutes. So: which of these is going to give me a useful answer?

Here's another reason you might consider tagging your items: you can make it clear what the eventual benefit of them is. I want to do well by the people who have already trusted me by buying (tag: RR, for "Rebuilding Rails.") I also want to find new buyers and do well by them (tag: MST, for "Mastering Software Technique.") Sometimes it's both (tag: ENT, for "Entrepreneur" generally.) If you have a few high-level goals it's fine to tag them. But more importantly, tagging them makes you think, "how does this help anybody?" And *that* is probably the most valuable result of the whole business.
