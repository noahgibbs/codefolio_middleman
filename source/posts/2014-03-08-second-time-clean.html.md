Isn't it wonderful when you get to go in and clean things up? The best,
for me, is when I've learned a lot in a year or two and I get to re-do
an old crufty program or a badly-designed page with what I've improved at.

For me, lately that's stuff with
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and
<a href="http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/examples/">Rickshaw</a>.
I've also been replacing other blog code with
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> &mdash; you've likely noticed.

What have you gone back and fixed lately?
