My wife and I both started out with a searing, bone-deep distrust of our own instincts. We get along well that way.

It takes us awhile to get to "average" at a lot of things other people are good at. Some things require you to trust yourself... At least, the way most people learn them.

But when we eventually hit average, we get better much, much faster than other people do. We had to work it all out from first principles.
