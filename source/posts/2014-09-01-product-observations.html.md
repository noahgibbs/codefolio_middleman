When I create and promote fun content, I get more subscribers, more
goodwill and more engagement.

When I ask my audience to buy things, or even sit through being asked
to buy things, I lose those things, by and large.

So this product trek is kind of an alternation &mdash; &quot;power up&quot;
my audience by giving good things, and then turn that into
&quot;hey guys, buy my class&quot; or &quot;please fill out this survey&quot;
or whatever I'm asking of them.

Unrelatedly: I don't feel like a person who sells products when I
have successes. I feel like a person who sells products when I'm
mid-slog and I know exactly what part comes next.
