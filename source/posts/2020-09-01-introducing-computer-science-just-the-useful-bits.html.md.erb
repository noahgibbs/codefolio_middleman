I've recently started a podcast called ["Computer Science: Just the Useful Bits."](https://justtheusefulbits.com) I interview a different professional developer, with a different background, each week. They'll let you know what parts of their education they think were good, which were bad, and which were worth emulating.

"When are we ever going to use this?" Indeed. That's what I'm answering, and not just me alone.

So far, I've published these two episodes:

* [Jason Swett: When Data Structures, Big-O Notation and Algorithms Were Completely Useless](https://anchor.fm/just-the-useful-bits/episodes/With-Jason-Swett-when-data-structures--big-O-notation-and-algorithms-were-completely-useless-eiaktt)
* [Tyler Williams: Hands-On Teaching Between Students; Formal and Informal Teaching](https://anchor.fm/just-the-useful-bits/episodes/With-Tyler-Williams-Hands-On-Teaching-Between-Students-Formal-and-Informal-Teaching-eitt1f)
