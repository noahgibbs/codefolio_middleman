Shoes3 is an old, creaky codebase from the Ruby 1.8 days. When working on
[Scarpe](https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe), I get to read through it
a lot to answer questions like, "what methods can you call on a Button?"
or "what is self supposed to be here?"

It provides a fun code reading challenge. I recorded a video to help folks
who work on Scarpe with the code reading. But it can be useful for all sorts
of folks.

The Ruby/C interface that it's using is basically the same now as it was
then, and it's what's used by native extensions. Peter Zhu's series of
articles [A Rubyist's Walk Along the C-side](https://blog.peterzhu.ca/ruby-c-ext/)
can also be really valuable here since it's using the same APIs.
