<a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com">Sebastian Marshall</a> interviewed me recently. I think it came out great!

<a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/building-ruby-castles-in-the-clouds-by-noah-gibbs">Building Ruby Castles in the Clouds</a> is the name of the interview.

We're also running a <a href="http://givegetwin.com">GiveGetWin deal</a> with copies of my book for $15, with proceeds going to charity. Been looking for a deal on <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a>? Now is the time.
