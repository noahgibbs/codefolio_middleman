Some famous people told me how to get superpowers. I did. They all happen to
agree on this topic. Now I'm going to tell you the same secret. I'll even
help you out a bit more.

The most powerful, important thing you can do is to get your code in front of
the people who will use it. Do it as fast as possible. Do it when it's not
ready yet. Do it when it makes you uncomfortable.

What does that have to do with superpowers, though? We'll get there. But first,
more about shipping code.

## But It's Not Ready!

Jeff Atwood, the guy who started <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_so">Stack Overflow</a>, knows
all the excuses. That's why he wrote
<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/" target="_atwood">Version 1
Sucks, But Ship It Anyway</a>. It's worth a read.

In the end, it boils down to this. You're somebody who is reading about
software when you don't have to. Right here in this post, even! You care about
your craft.

True software craft is about <a
href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/shipping-isnt-enough/" target="_atwood2">making software
people want to use &mdash; that is worth using (Jeff Atwood again)</a>. To do that,
let them use it and <i>then</i> fix the problems they care about. And the faster you
find the problem, the cheaper it is to fix (see below, credit to gridshore.nl.)

You <b>want</b> to ship it "not ready." That's the easiest, best time to fix it.

## Shipping is a Superpower

Steve Jobs says <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_wikiquote">"Real Artists Ship"</a> &mdash; and he's right.

Seth Godin says that <a
href="http://99u.com/articles/6249/seth-godin-the-truth-about-shipping" target="_godin">you
don't ship because your lizard brain is defeating your innate brilliance</a>
&mdash; and he's right. When he talks about "the resistance" you should assume
he means it from <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/The-War-Art-Through-Creative/dp/1936891026" target="_warofart">The
War of Art</a>.

When <b>I</b> say that shipping early means you serve your craft better and you're more focused, I'm
saying it gives you a superpower &mdash; it makes you better than you would
be otherwise, and better than other people are now.

You can ignore a superpower that you'd otherwise use. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben" target="_uncleben">I hear there may be some
down-side to ignoring the power the world hands you</a>, but it's up to you.

## Where Do Superpowers Come From?

But then, how would you get <b>better</b> at shipping, other than just doing it?

You do you get your superpower?

You could make shipping easy, <a
href="http://puppetlabs.com/blog/continuous-integration-success-depends-on-automation" target="_puppet">using
careful automation</a>. You could learn the tools that make this powerful,
which only a few people use yet.

But to do it right, there are many important ones. <a
href="http://vagrantup.com" target="_vagrant">Vagrant</a>, <a
href="http://getchef.com" target="_chef">Chef</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian" target="_librarian">Librarian</a> and <a
href="http://capistranorb.com" target="_capistrano">Capistrano</a> are my favorite constellation of
tools, and that's already a huge amount to learn.

But... <b>How do you get your superpowers</b> then?

## I'd Love to Help

Most of these aren't hard <b>once you set them up</b>. Setting them up is
horrible, but it only happens once.

Want to do that in fast-forward and skip straight to having superpowers?

<a href="http://rubymadscience.com">I can help</a>. I can get those things
working smoothly for you. And from there on, you can just enjoy being
<b>That Guy or Gal Who Ships Things</b>.

Some people <a
href="http://unicornfree.com/2010/i-made-216668-from-products" target="_amyhoy">make a career
and a ton of money from that superpower</a> (Amy is a teacher of mine.)

By the way &mdash; I'm looking for customers for a pilot class. Wouldn't
you love to be in the <b>first</b> batch that I help get their superpowers?

Email me back. I'm the.codefolio.guy at Google's well-known email provider.

The pilot program will open this week. I'd love you to be in it. Read <a
href="http://rubymadscience.com">the product web site</a> for more details.
