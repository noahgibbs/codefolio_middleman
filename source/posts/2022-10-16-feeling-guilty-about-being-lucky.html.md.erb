I know a young lady who had done quite well for herself in computer programming. I don't ***really*** know how she feels about this, but I have some suspicions. An old fellow is used to seeing certain signs.

I won't say she's "had an easy time of it" because you don't get to be an excellent software developer without work. But she clearly feels like other people have had it harder than she did. Which they absolutely have.

Sometimes a giant piece of luck falls into your lap. It's easy to feel guilty about it.

So let's talk about that.

## Flavours of Luck

You might reasonably ask, what do I know about this? It's a fair question. It would be fashionable to point out that I'm a cisgendered white man, which I am. But it's more relevant to point out that I was born in 1976.

There are some oddities about birth years in my profession. Did you know that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both born the same year? It turns out that to get the largest head start in computers, you had to be in the computer labs ***just*** as that became possible. If I had been born slightly sooner and been in a better spot geographically, perhaps I'd have been more successful yet.

There's always somebody luckier than you are. But I did pretty well.

My parents paid my way through Carnegie Mellon University. It was already an excellent computer science school, but we hadn't quite figured out why that was important. I graduated in 1998. Pictures in our web browsers happened in 1996.

I rode in on a tidal wave, is what I'm saying. Not the very biggest tidal wave &mdash; that was the Gates/Jobs wave. But a pretty darn big one.

I also had a good disposition for computers. I've [stuck with them, solidly, since I was eight](/posts/the-forty-year-programmer).

So: I'm a lucky guy. And while I've done a lot of work as a programmer, I did nothing at all to earn that tidal wave. That was pure dumb luck.

## Ah, To Be Young and Stupid Again

When you're young and get handed a big chunk of un-earned luck, you have some choices.

For instance, you can cover your eyes and sing out "la, la, LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU" when anybody points it out.

It's a popular choice.

You can declare that you're going to earn this, and work like the devil. I try for this one, with mostly decent success.

Here's the interesting thing: none of those things changes that you got lucky. In fact, it's likely that your luck magnified all all your work. So in some sense, the harder you work and the more you succeed, the ***more*** you owe to luck.

This is, of course, an unpopular thing to observe. I'm intentionally not further mentioning the really obvious, egregious examples of it. Nonetheless, luck has a tendency to be a multiplier, not an addition. You may make of that what you wish.

## So What About This Girl?

The girl in question has had a lot of helping hands upward, over the years (as have I.) She has a lot of self-confidence and gives the impression that she's going to get somewhere with or without you. Ironically, that's who people love to help best.

And you can watch her feel guilty about it. Many other people don't get all the advantages she does (some get more, of course.)

But what do you do, if you're somebody who gets all these benefits?

What if you're not even worthy of them?
