I talk about Coding Studies in a few places &mdash; my [RubyConf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33fAzjOTaDE) and [my book Mastering Software Technique,](https://software-technique.com), for instance. But lots of "how-to" is never as powerful as just seeing something in action. So the video here shows me doing a simple coding study.
