This is all slapped together quickly in Camtasia.

Audio:
* Record, mix-to-mono, 150% loudness

Camtasia:
* Export audio-only then drop the m4a in the Git directory

YouTube version (no longer?):
* Title card w/ basic copyright attribution, do *not* pause at the beginning
* Export local file w/ defaults from Camtasia, then upload to YouTube
* Unlisted video, basic attribution in description
