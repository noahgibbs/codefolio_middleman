There are some other really great articles about software dev career progression.

Patrick McKenzie's [Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) *is* about salary negotation. But more than that, it's a sophisticated work of corporation psychoanalysis. When you're dealing with a company, you ***and the company*** can get more value out of you adjusting your approach. And not just during the initial negotiation.

[The Developer Mid-Career Slump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTXmZssW9q0) was my previous similar talk. It's more autobiographical, less advice. I think it holds up pretty well.
