## Email Classes

On Codefol.io, there are email classes you can sign up for...

I'm still integrating with my email software on the clickable links, though.

* Rails Internals class
* Database Migrations class
* Software Technique and Practice class

## Email Policy

I use MailChimp (and possibly soon ConvertKit.) It's standard email software - better than most, I tend to think. MailChimp tracks it when you click on a link in email I send you.

It also tracks when you open email (or don't.) That part is less exact - it's often wrong or inexact, especially for GMail accounts. But it *attempts* to track when you open email and sometimes succeeds.

I do a certain amount of trying to figure out whether you liked my stuff or you didn't based on clicks and opens. If you discover I'm doing tracking in my emails... It should be normal MailChimp stuff, neither more nor less. It's attempting to track clicks and opens.

I also do a certain amount of tracking your visits to my web site using Google Analytics. I sometimes try to put email tracking and web site tracking together. But I do enough data science to find it amusing to try, and I'm curious what you folks enjoy and what you don't.

I get enough information that I *could* track your personal visits and see what you clicked on and/or opened. I don't generally do that. If I look at one person, it's normally to get an idea of what a single typical visitor *might* do. I only want to know about "you" in order to make better software and/or writing about software for you.

In theory, somebody might some day come up with a way to infer very personal information about you from how you visit my site. I've seen distant, theoretical ideas of how such a thing might work. But there's no practical, workable way to do it that I have access to. So I'm not doing anything like that. I'm also not interested, but "it's impossible" requires less trust on your part.
