## Email Classes

On Codefol.io, there are email classes you can sign up for. If you sign up from a blog post or topic, I assume you'd like to hear about that topic. Or you can click a link in the class email to permanently opt out of that class. Or unsubscribe, of course.

MailChimp takes you opting out of an email series seriously - you can never again sign that email address up for that email series, full stop. If you want to later take that email class, consider using an additional email address. If you don't already have multiple addresses, a [GMail alias can be a great choice](https://www.lifewire.com/create-gmail-alias-4580315), or an alias at your ISP or domain if available. Or you can make a new temporary address somewhere - a new GMail address will cheerfully forward to somewhere else, for instance.

If you want a specific class you can go to the matching "topics" page and sign up for my mailing list. Not every topic is guaranteed to have a class, so you may wind up with the Ruby on Rails internals class. It's pretty good, in case that helps ;-)

## If You're Worried

There's more explanation in the next section, but...

If you're really worried about being tracked, I have three recommendations:

1) Sign up for plaintext email instead of HTML - from me and in general
1) Use a temporary email address of some kind, which could forward to a real one (or not)
1) Or just unsubscribe; if you're not reading email from me then I'm clearly not tracking it

Despite the verbose explanation below, I'm doing about the normal amount of "online guy trying to sell you things" tracking and analytics. I just think that, as software developers, you may care more about the details.

I also don't want you tracked if you don't want to be. I *do* want to make my stuff better, but it's silly for me to be all sneaky about it. I'll try to be a straight shooter with you, and you can decide what you think of it.

Also, if you want more detail about any of this, email me. I'm happy to talk about it. And my responses to you don't go through MailChimp or anything. It's just me emailing with you, same as with anybody.

## How I Email You

I use MailChimp. It's standard email software for small business marketing - better than most, I tend to think. MailChimp tracks when you click on a link in email I send you. It will tell me about that, if I check.

It also tracks when you open email (or don't.) That part is less exact - it's often wrong or inexact, and it guesses based on loading images in the email. But it *attempts* to track when you open email and sometimes succeeds.

I do a certain amount of trying to figure out whether you liked my stuff or you didn't based on clicks and opens. If you discover I'm doing tracking in my emails... It should be normal MailChimp stuff, neither more nor less. It's attempting to track clicks and opens. I told it to.

I do *not* track clicks in plain-text emails, and I don't have any way to track opens in plain-text emails. So if that level of tracking is intrusive, I'd recommend signing up for plain text emails.

I also do a certain amount of tracking your visits to my web site using Google Analytics. I sometimes try to put email tracking and web site tracking together, with mixed results. But I do enough data science to find it amusing to try, and I'm curious what you folks enjoy and what you don't.

I get enough information that I *could* track your personal visits and see what you clicked on and/or opened. I don't generally do that. If I look at one person, it's normally to get an idea of what a single typical visitor *might* do or it's to debug a problem or potential problem. I only want to know about "you" in order to make better software and/or writing about software for you.

In theory, somebody might some day come up with a way to infer very personal information about you from how you visit my site. I've seen distant, theoretical ideas of how such a thing might work. But there's no practical, workable way to do it that I have access to. So I'm not doing anything like that. I'm also not interested, but "it's impossible" requires less trust on your part.
