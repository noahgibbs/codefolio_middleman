## Email Policy

I use MailChimp. It's standard email software - better than most, I tend to think. MailChimp tracks it when you click on a link in email I send you.

It also tracks when you open email (or don't.) That part is less exact - it's often wrong or inexact, especially for GMail accounts. But it *attempts* to track when you open email, anyway.

I do a certain amount of trying to figure out whether you liked my stuff or you didn't based on things like that. If you find tracking in the emails... It should be normal MailChimp stuff, neither more nor less.

I also do a certain amount of tracking your visits to my web site, and I try to put those things together (email tracking, web site tracking) with mixed results. But I do enough data science to find it amusing to try, and I'm curious what you folks enjoy and what you don't.
