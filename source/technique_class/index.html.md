To put a &quot;do this&quot; link in email, it seems that I need
something to link you *to*. So: thanks for requesting the
Software Technique email class! If everything goes right and you
haven't taken it before with this email address, you should see
an acknowledgement very soon by email that you signed up.

(If somebody sent you this link and you just showed up in your
browser... Sorry! That doesn't tell MailChimp how to email you.
Maybe sign up on the right-hand side there?)

If you want it but you've done it before, it may be worth it
to read up on [GMail aliases](https://www.labnol.org/internet/multiple-email-addresses-in-gmail/17426/),
if you have a GMail address.
You can basically add &quot;+st&quot; after your GMail name and it
will still get to you, which lets you &quot;subscribe&quot; again
as though it were a completely different email address. Though
keep in mind, that means you'll get new emails from me multiple
times (which is still pretty painless in GMail.)
