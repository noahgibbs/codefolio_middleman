Hiya!

My name is Noah Gibbs.  I'm the author of <a
href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a>, a book about
understanding Ruby web frameworks by building your own, structured
like Rails.

I've spoken at some conferences and meetups and stuff.

I'm a dad.  It's amazing.

I'm a long-time professional Ruby-and-stuff developer.

I've written <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/">a lot of random
Ruby code</a>.

I started coding at eight years old, and I'm a lot older than that
now.  I've never had a real non-programming job.
