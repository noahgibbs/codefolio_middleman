Hiya!

My name is Noah Gibbs. I'm the author of <a
href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a>, a book about
understanding Ruby web frameworks by building your own, structured
like Rails.

I believe every programmer should keep a portfolio, like visual artists do. <a href="https://codefol.io/portfolio">I think mine is pretty decent</a>. Feel free to steal code from it.

I've <a href="https://codefol.io/speaking">spoken at some conferences and meetups and stuff</a>.

I'm a dad. It's amazing.

I'm a long-time professional Ruby-and-stuff developer.

I've written <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/">a lot of random
Ruby code</a> (and non-Ruby code.)

I started coding at eight years old, and I'm a lot older than that
now. I've never had a real non-programming job.
