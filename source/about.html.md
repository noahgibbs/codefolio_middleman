Hello.

I teach various programming skills. I speak at conferences, write books and email courses, give workshops, talk in person. I've led teams and worked for Silicon Valley startups. But these days I'm usually at a conference, teaching or off by myself. Inverness, Scotland is beautiful and a lot less dry.

You ever replace the roof on your house? Maybe you called out a grizzled old guy who has spent the last 30 years fixing roofs? He probably gave you a few ways you could fix it, but you could tell by how he said it that there was a *right* way. He wasn't going to tell you what to do, no sirree, but if it were *his* roof... Well, he knows what he would do. I'm that guy, but for software.

Some things you may have heard of:

* <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a>, a book about
understanding Ruby web frameworks by building your own, structured
like Rails. </a>
* <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com">AppFolio's engineering blog</a>, with
many posts about Ruby performance. I was their Ruby Fellow for years, focused on
Performance for Ruby 3x3.

I believe every programmer should keep a portfolio, like visual artists do. <a href="https://codefol.io/portfolio">I think mine is pretty decent</a>. Feel free to steal code from it.

I've <a href="https://codefol.io/speaking">spoken at many conferences and meetups</a>.

I'm a dad. It's amazing.

I'm a long-time professional <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/">software developer, with a focus on Ruby these last few years</a>. Before that there was a lot more C and other systems programming.

I've never had a real non-programming job. So I hope this "computer" thing doesn't turn out to be a fad.
