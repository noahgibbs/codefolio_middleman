Here's the thing: if you want to meet Britney Spears, odds are good that Britney Spears doesn't want to meet you.

If you're Lady Gaga, then Britney Spears probably <i>does</i> want to meet you.

But if you say, "hey, I'm Lady Gaga!" and you're not, that doesn't work.

You have to go be Lady Gaga, out where everybody can see.

And then Britney may say, "hey, you seem pretty cool. Wanna hang out?"
