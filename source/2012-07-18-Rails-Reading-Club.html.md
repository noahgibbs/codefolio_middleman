Some day I would love to put together a Rails Reading Club.  Like a book club, but for the Rails source.

I love fun weird Ruby trivia, and the Rails code is full of it!

As Joel Spolsky said, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000053.html">reading code is like reading the Talmud</a>.  You should get together and pore over the lines and debate properly over the intention and the expression of it.

Some day I'm going to find the right group of Ubergeeks and we're going to make that happen.
