Interested in learning Ruby? I have some advice for that.

If you're in bootcamp, first, stick with it. If you're in a bootcamp at the moment, you're probably very busy. I wouldn't add a lot of active education *outside* the bootcamp until you've finished inside it.

After that, there are a number of good books. "Metaprogramming Ruby" is near and dear to my heart. "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" can be good, but may also be a bit basic for you, depending.

99 Bottles of OOP is both a good early-career book and one of the best practices of the fundamentals I have ever seen - I had over 20 years of experience when I worked through it and it's still one of the most valuable books I have *ever* read. 99 Bottles was a big inspiration for my book [Mastering Software Technique](https://software-technique.com).

As you get more advanced in Ruby, consider learning more about its internals. Patrick Shaughnessy's book "Ruby Under a Microscope" is still the classic for that, and almost all of what it teaches is still valid for the current Ruby interpreter.
