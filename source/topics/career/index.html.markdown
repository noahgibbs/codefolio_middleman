About your career, including businesses and how to fit into them:

* [Patrick McKenzie on Salary Negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) - I didn't write this, but I recommend it to everyone who will listen; nominally about salary negotiation, but actually a sophisticated work of corporate psychoanalysis
* [How to Produce and Learn at the Same Time](/posts/how-to-produce-and-learn-at-the-same-time/) - probably *my* favourite post I've written for other developers
* [There's No Such Thing as Knowing Your Computer All the Way to the Bottom](/posts/no-such-thing-as-knowing-coding-all-the-way-to-the-bottom/) - a useful antidote for some common bad advice
* [How to Stop Being Afraid of 'The Computer Science Thing'](/posts/the-computer-science-thing/) - another useful antidote to a common worry
* [Fully-Loaded Engineer Hours](/posts/fully-loaded-engineer-hours/) - a very useful mental model for negotiating and for day-to-day build-versus-buy decisions, taken from an excellent Patrick McKenzie post
* [Brian Brushwood: the Day Teller Gave Me the Secret to My Career in Magic](/posts/brian-brushwood-and-tellers-secret-to-a-career-in-magic/) - copied to avoid it sinking into the swamp of the Internet; this is amazing career advice for everybody, not just magicians
* [You - Yes, You - Can Speak At a Conference](http://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2017/1/9/you-yes-you-can-speak-at-a-conference) - what you already know right now that would make a great conference talk (I wrote this for AppFolio, it's on their site)
* [BigCo New Employee Training - Inside Voice](/posts/BigCo-New-Employee-Training-Inside-Voice/)
* [Tech Companies: Why You Can't Hire Awesome Engineers and How to Fix It](/posts/tech-companies-why-you-cant-hire-engineers-and-how-to-fix/) - a reaction to one of those posts from a company about how desperately they'd like to find this particular kind of developer... who, realistically, they wouldn't hire anyway.
* [What Makes a Good Project Manager?](/posts/the-good-project-manager/) - from a developer's point of view... mostly
* [HR and Rotting Culture](/posts/hr-and-rotting-culture/) - why fearing HR may be a sign of cultural rot, or might not
* [On Hiring a Developer](/posts/On-Hiring-a-Developer/) - I wrote this to a guy looking for a developer; for you, maybe it's a peek into the other side's point of view
* [Developer, Not Coder](/posts/Developer-not-Coder/) - some ways to work toward being a senior developer
