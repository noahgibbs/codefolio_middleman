About career, including businesses and how to fit into them:

* [How to Produce and Learn at the Same Time](/posts/how-to-produce-and-learn-at-the-same-time/) - probably *my* favourite post I've written for other developers
* [Fully-Loaded Engineer Hours](/posts/fully-loaded-engineer-hours/) - a very useful mental model for negotiating and for day-to-day build-versus-buy decisions, taken from an excellent Patrick McKenzie post
* [Brian Brushwood: the Day Teller Gave Me the Secret to My Career in Magic](/posts/brian-brushwood-and-tellers-secret-to-a-career-in-magic/) - copied to avoid it sinking into the swamp of the Internet; this is amazing career advice for everybody, not just magicians
* [Soft Skills by John Sonmez](/posts/soft-skills-by-john-sonmez/) - a review of one of the small number of *career* books for developers, about non-dev skills
* [BigCo New Employee Training - Inside Voice](/posts/BigCo-New-Employee-Training-Inside-Voice/)
* [Tech Companies: Why You Can't Hire Awesome Engineers and How to Fix It](/posts/tech-companies-why-you-cant-hire-engineers-and-how-to-fix/) - a reaction to one of those posts from a company about how desperately they'd like to find this particular kind of developer... who, realistically, they wouldn't hire anyway.
* [What Makes a Good Project Manager?](/posts/the-good-project-manager/) - from a developer's point of view... mostly
* [HR and Rotting Culture](/posts/hr-and-rotting-culture/) - why fearing HR may be a sign of cultural rot, or might not
* [On Hiring a Developer](/posts/On-Hiring-a-Developer/) - I wrote this to a guy looking for a developer; for you, maybe it's a peek into the other side's point of view
* [Developer, Not Coder](/posts/Developer-not-Coder/) - some ways to work toward being a senior developer
