About software technique and practice (see also [my book Mastering Software Technique](https://software-technique.com) and [the career page](/topics/career)):

* [How Not to be Afraid of &quot;The Computer Science Thing&quot;](/posts/the-computer-science-thing) - important, and I think underappreciated&hellip;
* [Practice Software Technique with a Single Idea and a Time Limit](/posts/single-idea-with-time-limit/)
* [You Learn the Most with Throwaway Prototypes](/posts/you-learn-the-most-with-throwaway-prototypes/)
* [What You Learn by Repeating Exercises](/posts/what-you-learn-by-repeating-exercises/), along with my definition of a good exercise
* I had a [lovely podcast interview with Jason Swett](https://www.codewithjason.com/completely-unfocused-utterly-mind-blowing-conversation-noah-gibbs-rails-jason-podcast/) which veered off into learning, computing fundamentals and all sorts of other things
* [How to Produce and Learn at the Same Time](/posts/how-to-produce-and-learn-at-the-same-time/) - probably *my* favourite post I've written for other developers

Not by me:

* ["Mechanical Confidence", an interview with Adam Cuppy on the Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-429-mechanical-confidence-with-adam-cuppy/) - his basic hypothesis is that confidence comes from rehearsal and routine
