# Codefol.io

Periodically I rewrite Codefol.io in something vaguely-modern and
attempt to adapt the old content. It's... a good exercise?

My last rewrite was into Octopress with Octostrap, which wasn't
bad. It's definitely showing its age, though.

Middleman is a lot cleaner and simpler, which means I'll have to
configure the hell out of it to get what I want... But it may be
easier to do the next adaptation in a few years? And I can use
Bootstrap manually rather than in a preconfigured way, which is
probably a good idea. It'll also let me use a reasonably modern
Bootstrap - it's improved a fair bit.
